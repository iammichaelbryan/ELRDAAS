The Elsa Leo-Rhynie Hall Domestic Affairs Automation Software
The Elsa Leo-Rhynie Towers Hall, also known as the ELR Towers, is a prominent student facility located at the heart of the University of the West Indies (UWI) Mona Campus. The hall comprises five distinct towers: The Tower of Olympus, The Tower of Phoenix, The Tower of Apollo, The Tower of Orion, and The Tower of the Mighty Dragons. Each academic year, it accommodates over 600 students.
Despite its grandeur, there is an urgent need for a transformative software solution. Currently, the hall lacks a real-time tracking system for resident concerns and the laundry system is disorganized and inefficient. Additionally, there is no central repository for hall maintenance information.
Our comprehensive automation efforts aim to seamlessly integrate every facet of the hall’s operations, including laundry and resident concerns, to address these issues. This software solution is intended to enhance the living experience of the residents, providing them with greater control and transparency in managing their domestic affairs. It will also assist the administrative personnel in managing operations and providing support and guidance to the residents. This approach ensures that the software remains student-centric, prioritizing the needs of the students and key hall personnel.
